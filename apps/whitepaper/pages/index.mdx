## Problem

The Internet is built on open-source projects, developed by global developer communities whose codebases are freely available. Over the past 80 years, open-source software has shifted from a niche hobby to the foundation of all innovation. However, these developers receive no tangible rewards for their significant contributions.

## Solution

We plan to create a decentralized protocol to improve the sustainability and integrity of open-source software. It allows developers to benefit from their work in a trustless way. We believe that good rewards for open-source work can't happen unless there's an independent and autonomous system for recognizing impact and a way for community members to share their discoveries and constructive opinions on a project or a developer's work.
